# Description
A generic activities calendar view that is really designed for office managers or those who need to see a large group of user's activities in one place. You could use the O365 calendar as well but this calendar may display a large number of activities better and you can filter them quite easily and see the "selected" calendar event (activity) in the detail panel.

Use the O365 calendar as much as possible before switching to this one.


# TODOS
* Allow rescheduling by drag and dropping.
* Add team filtering.
* Add more links to open related material.
